                               INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

Run wind direction to calculate mean wind direction from ensemble realizations

positional arguments:
  INPUT_FILE            A path to an input NetCDF file to be processed
  OUTPUT_FILE           The output path for the processed NetCDF

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --profile             Switch on profiling information.
  --profile_file PROFILE_FILE
                        Dump profiling info to a file. Implies --profile.
  --backup_method {neighbourhood,first_realization}
                        Backup method to use if there is low confidence in the
                        wind_direction. Options are first_realization or
                        neighbourhood, first_realization should only be used
                        with global lat-lon data. Default is neighbourhood.
